# SimpleAppwithChatBot

1. Data Visualization
   source files and graph images are in Data visualization folder, but you won't be able to run the code in Jupyter notebook cause you don't have the data

2. Simple one-page App and Chatbot
   I builded a one-page web App using React, with Chatbot module integrated into this page, in the form of question-answering. The chatbot is using the WitAPI, but the decision tree is defined and trained by myself. I did not spent much time in implementing the chatbox with scrolling dialogues.
   
   Installation:
   1. Download the folder
   2. Navigate into the folder
   3. type "npm install" in the terminal
   4. type "node start" in the terminal and web app will be run on port 5000
   
   Or you may use WebStorm to open the folder, and just right click on server.js, then click run.
